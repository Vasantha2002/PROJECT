### Case Study: MHC-PMS (Mental Health Care-Patient Management System)

- A patient information system to support mental health care is a medical information system that maintains information about patients suffering from mental health problems and the treatments that they have received.
- Most mental health patients do not require dedicated hospital treatment but need to attend specialist clinics regularly where they can meet a doctor who has detailed knowledge of their problems.
- To make it easier for patients to attend, these clinics are not just run in hospitals. They may also be held in local medical practices or community centres.
- The MHC-PMS (Mental Health Care-Patient Management System) is an information system that is intended for use in clinics.
- It makes use of a centralized database of patient information but has also been designed to run on a PC, so that it may be accessed and used from sites that do not have secure network connectivity.
- When the local systems have secure network access, they use patient information in the database but they can download and use local copies of patient records when they are disconnected.
